# A Freelancing History

This is a brief history of my time as a freelancer. It is a story, really, of a journey that I should have always seen would lead me to full-time development. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Timeline components come from [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
